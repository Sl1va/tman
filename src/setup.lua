Found the logic in git project. File name setup.c:
    1. Run this module before any command. Pro'ly all but might use a flag to
       specify it.
    2. Make sure tman directory is safe to perform any command. It frees the
       rest of code logic from checks and crap like that.

    1. Check that every task ID has corresponding. Yeah, all. It shouldn't take
       that much time is it seems. Tho the rest of the code'll run no error.
       If it slows down performance, rewrite it in C. Sounds good?
        a) unit file
        b) task dir
