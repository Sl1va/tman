In progress:
    1. Refactor taskunit.lua. It looks messy and disgusting
    2. Refactor git.lua. Looks messy
    3. Properly fix backup and restore commands
    6. Add file lock to task units.
    8. Move git.lua modulo more rubost and bring some order into it.
    9. Add task and command suggestions.
    11. Add git commit checker and pattern.
    12. Keep an eye on the Cargo's stylua. It's good but heavy.
    13. install.sh: separate user and developer tool installation.
    14. Make all commands alike so they can be put in array and called in main().
    15. Refactor git module. Getting bigger and messier.
    16. `getopt' vs `getops'. Which one to use?


Gotta work on (still):
    4. Maybe there's a better config file than Lua module.
    7. Gotta think about some stuff like additition elements, diff date, etc.


Done:
    4. Find a good config syntax to fit options, install path, repos, etc.
    5. Move taks dir/file structure into the file. Leave system ones in the code.
    7. Move branch formation pattern to config file cuz it can be diff for other.
    10. Do git rebase if it's possible without merge conflics.
