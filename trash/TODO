In progress:
1. Refactor taskunit.lua. It looks messy and disgusting
2. Refactor git.lua. Looks messy
3. Properly fix backup and restore commands
6. Add file lock to task units.
7. Move branch formation pattern to config file cuz it can be diff for other.
8. Move git.lua modulo more rubost and bring some order into it.
9. Add task and command suggestions.
11. Add git commit checker and pattern.
12. Keep an eye on the Cargo's stylua. It's good but heavy.

Done:
4. Find a good config syntax to fit options, install path, repos, etc.
5. Move taks dir/file structure into the file. Tho leave system ones in the code.
10. Do git rebase if it's possible without merge conflics.
