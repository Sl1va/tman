In progress:
    6.   Add file lock to task units.
    9.   Add task and command suggestions.
    11.  Add git commit checker and pattern.
    12.  Keep an eye on the Cargo's stylua. It's good but heavy.
    13.  install.sh: separate user and developer tool installation.
    16.  `getopt' vs `getops'. Which one to use?
    18.  Get rid of os.exit() in tman.lua. There's a better way.
    19.  Add module for default values so util doesn't break if no config is preesented.
    20.  `tman update' doesn't work if no current task. Fix it.
    22.  taskunit status - fix it or get rid of it.
    25.  Find a good way to delete unused and that no longer on remote repo.
    26.  Add support to work on different environments: work, personal, test.
    27.  Optimize db.lua: use task ID as table index.
    30.  core.lua gotta check config file as well.
    31.  Delete CUI from `tman set -d' command.
    32.  Diet repos over time.
    35.  tman.sh can't handle args with quotes `tman set -d "test task 2"'.
    36.  `tman set' always switch to task dir.
    37.  Move repos into directory cuz their number's getting bigger.
    38.  System and user config variable names might collide with each othre. Fix config.lua. Use diff namespaces.
    39.  Change checker in core.lua to check tman core, not tman base.
    40.  `tman sync' add `wd' util features. And maybe get rid of wd commmand dependency.
    41.  Need rubost API. It's discombobulated now.
    42.  Add option `-h' support into commands.


Gotta work on (still):
    4.   Maybe there's a better config file than Lua module.
    7.   Gotta think about some stuff like additition elements, diff date, etc.
    14.  Make all commands alike so they can be put in array and called in main().
         Is it really good idea?


Done:
    1.   Refactor taskunit.lua. It looks messy and disgusting
    2.   Refactor git.lua. Looks messy
    3.   Properly fix backup and restore commands
    4.   Find a good config syntax to fit options, install path, repos, etc.
    5.   Move taks dir/file structure into the file. Leave system ones in the code.
    7.   Move branch formation pattern to config file cuz it can be diff for other.
    8.   Make git.lua module more rubost and bring some order into it.
    10.  Do git rebase if it's possible without merge conflics.
    14.  Make all commands alike so they can be put in array and called in main().
    15.  Refactor git module. Getting bigger and messier.
    17.  Command `del': switch to previous task branch if it exists
    21.  `tman del' doesn't show task ID. Fix it.
    23.  Add unit for actvite repos.
    24.  git: Add support to download repos.
    28.  Delete sort() from db.lua, it shouldn't know about it.
    29.  taskunit.lua can't change task type.
    31.  Function die() should be used only in tman.lua.
    33.  `tman del' add task ID with description.
    34.  Find a place to store progname and version. There're in core.lua and help.lua now.
