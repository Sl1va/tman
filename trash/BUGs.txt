1. `tman` for some reason create file with task ID in task_new()
2. Main script always returns 0???
3. (done) Command `del` doesn't make the previous ID a new current when current ID's deleted.
4. When delete current task, `wd` sticks to wrong old current task.
5. If task exists, ID doesn't get created, tho taskunit file does.
